Motivation
----
I started this project to get a better understanding of quantum computers. In addition it allows me to tinker with quantum computing in my own personal enviorement which I can change however I see fit.

Project
----
This project consits of two parts:

1. The first part is a quantum computer emulator. The program will handle some basic QPU operations like a quantum computer would. This means the program has to adhere to physical rules from the quantum scale. 

1. The second part is a rudimentary programming language. In this project I will also construct a basic programming language to be a front for my emulator.
